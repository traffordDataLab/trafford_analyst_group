### Data Formats
Understanding the different formats used to store and represent data is an important aspect in analysis. Within the [datasets/example_data_formats](datasets/example_data_formats) folder we have provided the same extract of a dataset stored in 4 different formats ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](https://json.org/), [XLSX](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/file-formats-that-are-supported-in-excel-0943ff2c-6014-4e8d-aaea-b83d51d46247) and [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/)) allowing comparisons to be made.
