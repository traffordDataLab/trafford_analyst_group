# Trafford analyst group
Aiming to bring together analysts of all levels with different areas of expertise across Trafford Council and potentially beyond, to exchange tips, skills and ideas for the benefit of all.

The folders contain materials for workshops and example datasets. The web files relate to the webpage found at [http://www.trafforddatalab.io/trafford_analyst_group/](http://www.trafforddatalab.io/trafford_analyst_group/) which is itself intended as a learning tool for improving web skills, whilst also providing another way to access the materials.

### Data Formats
Understanding the different formats used to store and represent data is an important aspect in analysis. Within the [datasets/example_data_formats](datasets/example_data_formats) folder we have provided the same extract of a dataset stored in 4 different formats ([CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values), [JSON](https://json.org/), [XLSX](https://support.office.com/en-gb/article/file-formats-that-are-supported-in-excel-0943ff2c-6014-4e8d-aaea-b83d51d46247) and [XML](https://www.w3schools.com/xml/)) allowing comparisons to be made.
